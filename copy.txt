make a payment to one of these three destinations:
[ NHS preventative fund ]
[ A charity of your choice... ]
[ A cause you disapprove of... ]  (many economists feel that the fear of paying for a cause you do not sympathise with is a better motivator than simply spending money)

How much money can you not afford to lose [   ]
(you need to pledge an amount that will keep you on the straight and narrow)
